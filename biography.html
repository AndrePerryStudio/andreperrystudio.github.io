The company owns the 2xHD audiophile record label <a target="_blank" href="https://www.2xhd.com" title="2xHD website">www.2xHD.com</a> for which it has developed 2xHD Fusion, a proprietary mastering system that transforms analog and digital music master recordings into five high-resolution formats, including DXD and DSD. The label also produces audiophile recordings on vinyl, CD, and Reel-to-Reel audio tapes, applying the same high-quality standards, and additionally acts as a licensee of various labels.<p></p>

	<p><a name="1960" id="1960"></a><img src="biography/1960-1970.gif" alt="1960 - 1970" width="118" height="25"></p>
	<p><a class="FloatRight" href="biography/photos/Andre_Perry-1956.jpg" data-lightbox="roadtrip"><img src="biography/photos/Andre_Perry-1956.jpg" width="100" height="66"></a>Born in Verdun, a suburb of Montreal, Canada in 1937, Perry started his career as a jazz drummer and singer at 17. By the age 20, Perry was in demand as a studio musician and headed his own jazz group, winning the 1962 Grand Prix du Disque Canadien (which became l’ADISQ) for <i>‘most promising new male recording artist of the year’</i>.</p>

<p><a href="biography/photos/3.jpg" class="FloatLeft" data-lightbox="roadtrip"><img src="biography/photos/3tn.jpg" alt="Ca. 1962" width="100" height="73"></a><a href="biography/photos/4.jpg" class="FloatLeft" data-lightbox="roadtrip"><img src="biography/photos/4tn.jpg" alt="1967 - Studio d’enregistrement" width="100" height="73"></a>Perry opened his first recording facility in 1962, named Studio André Perry, located in Ville Brossard, a Montreal suburb.</p>
<p><a href="biography/photos/5.jpg" class="FloatRight" data-lightbox="roadtrip"><img src="biography/photos/5tn.jpg" alt="Andre Perry :: Jean-Pierre Ferland" width="100" height="73"></a>Since the very early years, Perry’s passion for excellence attracted most of Quebec’s artists to his studio. His significant contributions to the emerging careers of the leaders of the fledgling industry enhanced his reputation; <strong>Jean Pierre Ferland’s</strong> career building signature albums <strong>‘Jaune’</strong> and <strong>‘Soleil’</strong> were produced and recorded by Perry and are still considered musical landmarks in French Canada. In February 2008, in a survey made by Montreal’s premier newspaper <strong>La Presse</strong>, of the best albums released by Quebec artists of the past 50 years, Ferland’s album <strong>‘Jaune’</strong> and <strong>Robert Charlebois’s ‘Lindbergh’</strong> which was also produced and recorded by Perry during the same period, were voted number 1 and number 2 respectively. A similar poll made earlier by Montreal’s cultural news weekly <strong>Voir</strong>, produced the same results.</p>
<p><a href="biography/photos/5b.jpg" class="FloatLeft" data-lightbox="roadtrip"><img src="biography/photos/5btn.jpg" alt="Première console numérique" width="100" height="70"></a><a href="biography/photos/6.jpg" class="FloatRight" data-lightbox="roadtrip"><img src="biography/photos/6tn.jpg" alt="Magnétophones (Le Moog)" width="100" height="60"></a>Because of his thirst for new vistas &amp; constant search for the latest technology, Perry’s studio was first in Canada to make use of the most up-to-date tools such as: a transistorized console, the first synthesizer (the <strong>Moog</strong>), the first multi-track recorders, and so on. His innovations and reputation made him the obvious choice for special projects. Both the governments of Canada and of Quebec, selected Perry to produce the multi-media presentation for their respective <strong>Expo ’67</strong> host pavilions. The organizing committee of the Olympic Games (COJO) asked him to produce the music of the opening &amp; closing ceremonies for the <strong>1976 Montreal Olympic Games. Les Grands Ballets Canadiens</strong> called on his services to create a unique, multi-channel playback environment for their performance of The Who’s rock opera <strong>‘Tommy’</strong> at Montreal’s Place des Arts and choreographer <strong>Eddy Toussaint</strong> commissioned him to compose and produce an original electronic music for his ballet company – a rarity at the time. </p>

<p>In 1969 <strong>John Lennon </strong>and <strong>Yoko Ono</strong> came to Montreal and invited the world to their ‘Bed-In’ for Peace and Perry was asked to record what has since become the most famous anthem <strong>Give Peace A Chance</strong>. In appreciation for his additions in post-production and flair in the final mix, Lennon generously include Perry’s complete address on the record label – an unprecedented and never reproduced gesture. In the spring of 2009, on the 40 th anniversary of the event, the <strong>Montreal Museum of Fine Arts</strong>, with Yoko’s cooperation celebrated the happening with the creation of a very successful exhibition featuring memorabilia from the ‘Bed-In’ and the recording, Yoko’s memoires and artworks, and some of Perry’s contributions. A record number of viewers visited the exhibition.</p>

In 1970, prior to the digital era, he persuaded the multi-national Ampex Corp. To develop and manufacture a locking device to synchronize several multi-track recorders, expanding the range from 16 to 32 tracks.</p>

<p><a href="biography/photos/14.jpg" class="FloatLeft" data-lightbox="roadtrip"><img src="biography/photos/14tn.jpg" alt="avec Yaêl Brandeis" width="100" height="82"></a>André Perry conceived and designed <strong>LE STUDIO (Morin Heights)</strong> which he operated with his life and business partner <strong>Yaël Brandeis</strong>.&nbsp; Tucked in the Laurentian Mountains, 65 Km from Montreal, Le Studio was created based on a revolutionary concept, defeating acoustic rules, blending creativity with technology.&nbsp; Not only was it located outside the metropolitan area, but it was also daringly far from the mainstream global music scene.&nbsp; <a href="biography/photos/13.jpg" class="FloatRight" data-lightbox="roadtrip"><img src="biography/photos/13tn.jpg" alt="Complexe Le Studio" width="100" height="80"></a>The artists were embedded for the duration of the recording.<a href="biography/photos/12.jpg"></a></p>

<p><a href="biography/photos/20.jpg" class="FloatLeft"><img src="biography/photos/20tn.jpg" alt="SSL Console" width="100" height="50"></a><a href="biography/photos/15.jpg"></a>Recognizing the superiority of the Solid State Logic Mastersystem (SSL) console, Le Studio and London’s Abbey Road Studios were the first in the world to put it to use. Perry’s subsequent input through constant dialogue with the manufacturer was always appreciated and <a href="biography/photos/15.jpg" class="FloatRight"><img src="biography/photos/15tn.jpg" alt="Le Studio" width="100" height="63"></a>frequently integrated in future versions.&nbsp; The SSL console is still considered the world’s finest. In keeping with Perry’s tradition, Le Studio was also the earliest to introduce the digital recorder, (the two channel JVC BP90) using it first on the Police Synchronicity album.</p>
<p><a href="biography/photos/16.jpg" class="FloatLeft"><img src="biography/photos/16tn.jpg" alt="avec Cat Stevens" width="100" height="80"></a>Perry’s philosophy of nurturing the artists and musicians, as well as his personnel, redefined the studio industry, ending the era of dark, closed–in studio settings and transforming the approach to recording studio design. Rather than (as was the norm) imposing its own sound characteristics, stamping its own identity on the recordings, the studio’s flexibility and distinctive combination of European and North American equipment made it a versatile and sophisticated instrument. On listening to Chicago <i>13</i>, RUSH <i>Moving Pictures</i> +++, Cat Stevens - <i>Numbers</i>, <i>Izitso/ Back to Earth</i>, Corey Hart - <i></i>Boy in the Box</i>, Bee Gees- <i></i>Children of the World/Saturday Night Fever</i>, one can hear that each artist had its own sound.</p>
<p><a href="biography/photos/17.jpg" class="FloatRight" data-lightbox="roadtrip"><img src="biography/photos/17tn.jpg" alt="Rush" width="100" height="80"></a>The world-class music complex quickly attracted and became favorite of many international clients, including (alphabetically) <strong>Bryan Adams, the Bee Gees, David Bowie, Cat Stevens, Chicago, Julien Clerc, Roberta Flack, Corey Hart, Ian Hunter, Catherine Lara, Kim Mitchell, Nazareth, The Police, Keith Richards, Rush, Sting, Toronto</strong>.&nbsp; <a href="biography/photos/18.jpg" class="FloatLeft" data-lightbox="roadtrip"><img src="biography/photos/18tn.jpg" alt="with Sting" width="100" height="68"></a> Le Studio (Morin Heights), together with <strong>George Martin’s Air Montserrat</strong> – was named <i>Best Recording Studio in the World</i> by the industry’s leading magazine, Pro Sound News’ annual Recording &amp; Sound Awards. Through the years, over 500 million albums were sold of recordings made at Le Studio.</p>
<br><p><a href="biography/photos/19.jpg" class="FloatRight" data-lightbox="roadtrip"><img src="biography/photos/19tn.jpg" alt="avec The Bee Gees" width="100" height="83"></a>With Yaël Brandeis looking after the day-to-day operations of the studio, Perry continued to produce and record a diverse list of established and new artists, as well as to encourage young local artists by donating studio time and advice. He was also member of the board of directors and Canadian Independent Record Production Association (CIRPA) and founding member of the Association Québécoise de l’Industrie du Disque, du Spectacle et de la Vidéo (L’ADISQ) and of the CIRPA/L’ADISQ alliance.</p>

During the following years, the video facility was involved in the production of television specials for the American and Canadian networks including The World Challenge series starring Peter Ustinov, specials staring violinist Itzhak Perlman, the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, Nancy Reagan, Barbara Walters, industrial videos for SNC Lavalin and for the Kennedy Center, electronic signatures &amp; <a href="biography/photos/22.jpg" class="FloatLeft" data-lightbox="roadtrip"><img src="biography/photos/22tn.jpg" alt="Réception Studio Washington" width="100" height="67"></a> show openings for Radio Canada’s annual ‘Bye Bye’ &amp; ‘Les Beaux Dimanches’, NBC’s NFL openings and the Bill Cosby Show opening for CBS, as well as numerous music videos and television commercials.</p>

The following year the company raised $25,000,000.00 through a Swiss convertible bond issue to further its development.
